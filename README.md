## âœ¨ Hey ! âœ¨

ðŸ’¬ My name is Alexandre, I am 22 years old and I am a french student.
  - I currently study graphics programming (OpenGL, Raytracing program)
  - I love to use different programming language and I like to develop "tools" that make the life of developers easier.

Example of an image generated with a path-tracer program that i developped during a school-project this year.
